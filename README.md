I tried my best, but this was so hard to figure out, especially on a time crunch.
I understand it I get docked or whatever, but I NEEDED SOMETHING to submit because I don't understand code AT ALL right.
I also am perfectly aware of potential bugs within the code, I just don't know how to fix it.
I shooting for 10/50 for this one because this was certainly an attempt.
I'm sorry.
